### Papers

- **Physarum Can Compute Shortest Paths\[[arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0423v2)\]**  
*by Vincenzo Bonifaci, Kurt Mehlhorn and Girish Varma, accepted in Symposium on Discrete Algorithms(SODA) 2012.*  
A mathematical model has been proposed by biologists to describe the feedback mechanism used by the Physarum Polycephalum slime mold to adapt its tubular channels while foraging two food sources $s_0$  and $s_1$. We give a proof of the fact that, under this model, the mass of the mold will eventually converge to the shortest $s_0 - s_1$ path of the network that the mold lies on, independently of the structure of the network or of the initial mass distribution.

- **Streaming algorithms for some problems in log-space\[[pdf](http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~nutan/dlin-tamc.pdf)\]\[[slides](http://db.tt/rA4AsTt)\]\[[cite](http://www.springerlink.com/content/x157442437135m45/export-citation/)\]**  
*by Ajesh Babu, Nutan Limaye and Girish Varma, in Theory and Applications of Models of Computation(TAMC) 2010.*  
We give optimal randomized streaming algorithms for deciding membership of a subclass of Context Free Languages and for checking degree sequence of graphs.

- **Conductance and Eigenvalue\[[arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1756)\]**
For any finite-state ergodic time-reversible Markov chain with conductance $\phi$, and for any eigenvalue $\lambda \in (0,1)$ of the transition matrix,
$$ \phi^2 + \lambda^2 \leq 1 $$
