### INTERNSHIPS

------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------
2010   **Max Plank Institute for Informatics, Saarbruecken, Germany**  \
       I was selected by the Indo-Max Plank Center for CS, for doing an 
       internship in the area of graph algorithms. I spent 3 months at MPII
       Saarbruecken, and worked with Prof. Kurt Mehlhorn and Dr. Vincenczo 
       Bonifaci, on a distributed algorithm for computing shortest paths in a
       graph, inspired by the foraging abilities of the Slime Mold. A 
       mathematical model was previously proposed for the Slime Mold, which
       consist of an electrical network with time varying resistors. We 
       proved that the model converges to the shortest path in the graph.  

2008   **Google, Hyderabad**    \
       I did an internship during my final year of undergraduate education,
       at Google Hyderabad. I developed a generic distributed framework for
       testing the scalability of servers. The framework allowed for 
       specifying the format of requests that are accepted by the servers,
       and a distributed program will fire requests to the server at a 
       required rate. The responses could be gathered and statistics about
       these could be generated.
