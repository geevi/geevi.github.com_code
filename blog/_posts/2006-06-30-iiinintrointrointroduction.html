<blockquote>“I don't know if you have had the same experience, but the snag I always come up against when I'm telling a story is this dashed difficult problem of where to begin it. It's a thing you don't want to go wrong over, because one false step and you're sunk. I mean, if you fool about too long at the start, trying to establish atmosphere, as they call it, and all that sort of rot, you fail to grip and the customers walk out on you. Get off the mark, on the other hand, like a scalded cat, and your public is at a loss. It simply raises its eyebrows, and can't make out what you're talking about.”                       <br />                                 --P. G. Wodehouse - Right Ho, Jeeves</blockquote><br />I feel introduction must be the most difficult part of any writing. I actually wrote four posts even before I began this. I just don’t know how to make this interesting. So without further ado I am just plainly writing what I intend .<br /><br />        Through this blog I intent to give vent to my feelings and opinions that I have on different topics. I also intend to post info’s on various tech stuff (mainly on computers, IT, internet) that I know about, hoping some one will find it useful.<br /><br />I would very much be pleased to hear anyone commenting on my opinions whether it is for or against.  So do post your comments. Welcome to my blog.
