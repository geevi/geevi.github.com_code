$latex I - (\Pi^{1/2}P\Pi^{-1/2} + \Pi^{-1/2}P^{*}\Pi^{1/2})/2$ where $latex \Pi$ is the diagonal matrix with diagonal entires same as the stationary distribution. For the time-reversible case $latex \Pi^{1/2}P\Pi^{-1/2} = \Pi^{-1/2}P^{*}\Pi^{1/2}$, but this is not true in general for directed graphs.
