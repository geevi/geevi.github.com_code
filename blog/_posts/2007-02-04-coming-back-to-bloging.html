After a long long time i am visiting my blog again. There is a reason why this happened.<br /><br />Been feeling very lonely sitting in my room in front of the computer doing assingments, reading novel, watching movies. Though i have 2 room mates, both are not here. One went for a tour and the other has life time commitments. To ease this feeling i thought to do something else.<br /><br />I was thinking what to do when one is lonely. Does making a blog post serve a aolution? Well i would ask that question to my brother(a philosopher by all means). He would say that he enjoys writing.  Why would i want to do  this? I had read a book named " The diaries of a young girl" by Annie Frank. Its written duing the world wars, when annies family goes to hiding.<br /><br />Seeming like bloging does not serve a good solution.
