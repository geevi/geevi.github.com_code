Last time i was at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=marine+drive&amp;sll=18.9037,72.813143&amp;sspn=0.041981,0.084028&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Marine+Dr,+Mumbai,+Mumbai+City,+Maharashtra,+India&amp;ll=18.93714,72.816868&amp;spn=0.041973,0.084028&amp;z=14" target="_blank">marine drive</a> to see Mumbai celebrating diwali. It was an amazing sight to see rockets going from the entire length of marine drive.  Nearly the whole city is there bursting all kinds of fireworks. Though this time i decided to celebrate it in the solitude of my cubicle. I read some philosophy, listened to some music and chatted with some friends. I was feeling tranquil and pleasant. But when I got out of the TIFR building, it was the image of a warzone. The whole open space which was green was filled with smoke. I am sure the whole of mumbai was like that. I simply cannot describe the horror that I felt. Have people gone absolutely insane? Can't they see it's getting too much?

I remember celebrating diwali at my home which is in a small town in Kerala . People will keep the usual oil lamps on their concrete fenses. We burst crackers and enjoy fireworks. But then that was an hour at max and the population density is not so high. It was pleasant. Imagine the hugely crowded Mumbai City with lot of people bursting and enormous amount of fireworks for the whole night, covering the city completely with smoke. May be I am just being slightly over. But my reason didn't allow me to ignore the madness going all around.

I think this has to do with the mob mentality. When people all around you do something, you also do the same thing without applying the slightest amount of thought.

Somebody really have to do something about this.
