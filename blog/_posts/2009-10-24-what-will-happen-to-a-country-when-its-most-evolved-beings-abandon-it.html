<em>What prompted me to write this was a chat during my dinner. I met a person who had done his graduation from a University at my home state of kerala. We ranted about the poor quality of teaching and research back there and the politics involved in new appointments. People who teach there doesnt have clue about what they are talking about. They just read some books and recite it back during the class. It seems none of the people who do mtechs or phds in the best institutes in the country(ie the iits) ever join those universities. His opinion was that people who go to iits are running behind "big ambitions" and they dont care anything for their country. I felt that there is some truth in his opinion and the point of writing this was to support this feeling.</em>

The world is divided into countries, and the fate of each country is left with its people. This is a fact whether we like it or not, and i dont think this is going to change for a long time. Some people talk of globalization blurring boundaries, but this is true only for a few affluent who are rich enough so that they can spent each season in different countries. And offcourse the opinion of affluents are always over represented in media.

How is the fate of a country decided by its people? Its very much clear that it doesn't depend on each and every person in the country. Its not that each person doesnt have the power to change the world around them but most people doesnt choose to. Most people lack proper and complete knowledge of the world they live in. They live in fear, uncertainity and doubt. They just accept some dogmas just because they are lazy and dont want to think very much. But amoung a large community of people there are always a few evolved ones. Here by "evolved beings" i talk in the Darwinian sense. For human beings the most evolved beings are the ones that can think clearly, who has mastered the art of observing, reasoning and action. The ones that doesnt have fear, vanity or inferiouness in their minds. Such people can anticipate troubles that may come in the future and can chart the right path in their life or in whatever organisation or endeavor they are entrusted with.

What will happen to a country if its most evolved beings abandon it? Then the future is left with the less evolved ones. And obviously this will lead the community into troubles. Sometimes we talk of so much politics going on in the different organizations. Many social support systems failing. Rampant corruption and inefficiency. These are all because the right people are not in the right places.
