Many companies portray software piracy as their biggest threat. But interestingly I feel that it has brought only profits on a long term to some of the biggest software companies.
My father bought a computer first in 98. He is a lawyer and dearly needs it for typing a lot of documents. It was assembled and sent to us with all sorts of software like windows 98, ms office 97, many games etc.. preinstalled. It was the time when most advocates and other small shops which live on typing business were shifting from typewriters to computers. All of them obviously used pirated versions of ms office and windows. They found it so user friendly that they cannot think of an alternative. If a newer version comes, all of them get another pirated copy instantly. There are cases from different organizations that they deals with like banks, some companies etc. Since all these people have ms office all of these organizations who are capable of buying licensed version found it better to use windows and office.

So who are the losers and gainers here?  Did Microsoft loose anything because people who will any way never be able to afford their software at 20,000Rs, used pirated copies? They would rather use their old typewriter than spending 20,000 Rs on software alone. What really happened is ms software got popular. Lots of people with know how of their software were available. Many organizations started buying their software. Now about the losers. Back then nobody thought of an alternative since every one got great quality software for no money. There were open source alternatives, or even low cost softwares from corel and some other companies. If there wasn’t any piracy, I don’t find a reason that will prevent them from using open source. I agree that linux and open office had a long way to go to come up to the quality of ms software, but they could still be a substitute for typing, and basic tasks. By devoting some time and patience they can be used. But simply no one wanted to try them. If they all started using them, even new organizations would have started using them. So if many people started using them, more software and drivers would have been made to support them.

Today open source have become as user friendly as windows for most of the functions. It crashes more and is unstable some times, but that not unbearable. Still everyone uses ms suites. Now they have money to buy software, and they buy ms only, since that is only one they are familiar with. So I believe the open source movement was most badly hit by piracy. I wish strict laws of piracy are imposed, and that people will search for alternatives. MS would not have had this monopoly by which they reaped huge profits.

For large companies it might be viable to buy costly software, but for common man, small and medium scale enterprises (in developing and underdeveloped countries), its too costly. Still they use pirated versions. I am sure if there were strict following of laws, this wouldn’t be there. Consider if a similar software is there for free, why wouldn’t such people use it. Microsoft may not have expected this to happen, but its still a fact that it did help them in developing countries.

ps: having made a post praising ms office 07 before this, this is was not written with the intention of any balancing between os and ms. They were written in different times though they are posted in this order.
