If a graph(n vertex) has a maximum matching of size m edges, any maximal matching has size atleast m/2.(hint consider the complement of the maximal matching in the vertex set)

XOR(symmetric difference) of a n matching and a k matching is a set of even length cycles, even length alternating paths, odd length paths with 1 edge more from n matching(say a of them) and odd length augmentable paths(say b of them) for the k matching, such that a-b=n-k and b&lt;=n-k.
