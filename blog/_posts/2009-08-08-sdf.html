Given  and for , define.  is usually called a problem instance and  the set of solutions for . We can have four computational problems with 
Decision : Given , is ? or does there exists a solution?
Search : Given , find a  or find a solution.
Counting : Given , find  or find the number of solutions.
Uniform Generation : Given , generate a random element of  or generate a random solution
We are interested in a particular kind of relations, namely self-reducible relations.
