I am obsessed about making websites. I usually want it to be perfect. Making static html page is totally out of the question for me. So what do I do if I find that the institute webserver
<ul>
	<li> runs very old version of apache and php,</li>
	<li> has no database support and</li>
	<li> very low memory limit for php scripts?</li>
</ul>
I did a google search for "lightwieght CMS", found 2 cms's which doesnt require a database.

<a href="http://skybluecanvas.com/">SkyBlueCanvas</a> : This is the best one i found. It is a true black box. But I had already choosen my html template and i was lazy enongh to make it work with my template.

<a href="http://cmsfromscratch.com/">CMS from Scratch</a> : This one was ok. Not as good. I had to tinker with my html code. It is used for putting up <a href="http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/%7Egirish">my site</a>.

Update : i reverted back to plain old html files after 8 months. Using CMS is a pain for managing a simple homepage.
