Here i will be putting some "hard learnt lessons" from my life.
<blockquote>Causes will have an effect. The good news is that you can choose to do the causes that have good effects, and there is nothing to be afraid of.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Reasoning about what other people is thinking, or doing, or will think, or will do is a dangerous thing. Because most of the time you will be completely wrong.</blockquote>
