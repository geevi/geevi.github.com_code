Yet another day of my life starts at Poorni Guest House. Yesterday I used the "RUNNING MACHINE" and got really fond of it. So i decided that i would run on it everyday. The preset of 5 KM run seems to be too hard for me. By the end of 3 months i hope i can cover it easily. So I did a 0.5(i dont know what unit is used in that for distance) run at a speed of 10.<br /><br />After that i went down to read the newspapers. I found that there is another person staying in the guest house. We stared at each other, expecting the other person to start the intro. But it ended up that no one started. We exchanged a faint smile. I hope i had put a smile on my face. I meant to.<br /><br />After Day 2, my room mate and me decided that we will have food at the office. Not that the food is bad here, but at the office there is more variety stufff. We had to call for the cab again. Finally when we reached the office at 9, still most of the cubicles are empty. We had the breakfast. I ate vada and an apple. When I saw people using spoons for eating the vada which was some what hard, it was funny. One can eat vada with just plain hands, but still people prefer spoons. May be there is an unwritten social rule here like that. Since i was not sure I just used my hands. I had a call from home. I still havent got a new sim.Hoping google will give that too.<br /><br />Back to the desk only to find that the linux install is not completeà¥¤ The tech guy says that it will take 1 more hr. So i had nothing else to do. So thought of writing this. So far soo good. I am finding this interesting. Seems like i missed the appoinment on phone with my comentor. I can get his no only after my comp starts up. I will just wait for it to start and call him up, appologize.<br /><br />Well it turned out that even my co-mentor missed the schedule. He mailed me that its shifted to 11:30. Back to work. I went through the manuals that he asked me to read.<br /><br />Its lunch time. I am a bit frustrated. They make all sorts of dishes, label it with names.. It so confusing wat to take. You need to give a whole lot of specifications to get a burger or a sandwich.. which vegetables, sous etc<span></span>
