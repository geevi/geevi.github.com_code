I believe the ideal environment to be:
<ol>
	<li> the instructor just states the main problems in an area for which the theory was developed</li>
	<li>asks the students on how they would try to solve them</li>
	<li>as and when they get stuck introduce ideas from the theory that helps them.</li>
	<li>If they follow a different path from the theory, the instructor should encorage her to follow that path to its end.</li>
</ol>
One simplistic way of impletenting would be to  do 1. and 2.  in the  lectures, 2. as part of assignments and 4. as part of projects. However there might be additional constraints on time and in coming up with a resonable uniform evaluation of the students. So any exceptions to the simplisitic way will be choosen so that i am as close to the ideal system as possible.

The idea of teaching is to enable the student starting from simple ways to work with sophisticated techniques. The teachers duty is to provide a ladder, that the student can gradually climb rather than an uneven sequence of peaks. This way the student gradually develops confidence in him/herself and become self reliant eventually.
