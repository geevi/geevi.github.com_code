The image of my grandfather comes to my mind. A person who lived in a time when nothing was certain. He raised his family of 6 children and all of them  has enough to live peacefully . A farmer who could not stop working even during his last days.  I can never imagine him being angry. He had a very young heart. He used to follow cricket tournaments even when he was old. When ms dhoni started his career in the Indian cricket team, grandpa was immediately impressed by him. I remember him saying "people like dhoni should lead the team". Compared to his times I live in affluene, with a certain future(even in a worst case I think I will still get some job).His life (and I guess) his ambitions were simple yet he worked hard. I wish  to become some great scientist but
still I am lazy, and wasting life worrying about silly things. A sense of duty engulfs me now, but I don't know how long it will last.
