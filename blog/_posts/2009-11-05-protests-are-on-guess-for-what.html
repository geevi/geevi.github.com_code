TIFR research scholars are on protest mode, to be exact peaceful protest mode. The reason being the obvious one "we want a stipend hike". The latest pay commision reccomendations are being implemented and has increased the salaries across the board for faculties and staff in educational institutes. Research scholars not being considered as employees but rather students, have been ignored. The problem is atleast in TIFR, research scholars are supposed to be "highly talented and motivated"(to qoute the admission brochure) and some surely are. But how is TIFR going to attract these "highly talented and motivated" people if it doesn't provide competitive stipends? Unforunately the people who are supposed to decide on these matters lives in a office far away putting tick and cross marks on files. He doesn't understand the problem, for him the question is how to minimize the spending in this part so that spending in some other popular part is increased.
The director understands the problem but is left comletely powerless in this matter. But he stil have to endure the frustration of the students. Even some faculty believes that in the cause. But if the frustration overflows the goodwill might be lost.

Being a beneficiary I offcourse support the protest. But instead of just demanding a stipend hike, a broader goal must be set. That is to remove the innefficency in the system. This would ensure more support to the cause(even from within the high ranks of the system) and will hopefully give a permanent solution. But some narrow minded people say why care about what happens after we leave the institute and all I want is my stipend to be hiked as soon as possible.
