There are times when following a rule would be the most stupid thing to do. There are often things that offend most people even though they have a lot of good effects. The recent hot story for the media "Should Arundathi Roy be punished?" is one of them.
<h5>Following the law would be stupid</h5>
It is quite possible to cook up a case saying that the statements made could have incited violence in Kashmir which is already delicate and it might hold by the law. But what would be the consequences? First of all that action itself might incite more violence. It would also internationalise the issue. Some common sense needs to be applied, which apparently some politicians seem to lack completely. Its quite possible that internationalizing the issue would do good. Its time that Indians really got out of their fears of losing Kashmir. If the people there doesnt want to be part of India, there is no point in imposing others views on them. The logic that they will be more miserable that way, may not be correct and again its their decision to make(Its good to remember  Gandhian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaraj">Self Rule</a> here). Though there seems to be no agreement among the Kashmiri people on this.
<h5>A writer hardly understood</h5>
There is some opinion that Arundathi Roy is a person to be ignored. She seems to be making contradictory statements and always supporting the wrong side. There also seems to be a lot of hatred which is definitely not justified.

These are mostly due to the lack of historical knowledge of what writers are. Writers write what comes to their mind. They are not concerned about consistency of their statements unlike how a politician should be. Gandhi once famously said
<blockquote>My aim is not to be consistent with my previous statements on a given question, but to be consistent with truth as it may present itself to me at a given moment.</blockquote>
She made statements about how some Kashmiri's perceive the situation and Maoists being "Gandhian with guns". Her story probably has a lot of truth in it. Its like we have a person who gives words to feelings of some people who couldn't have done it otherwise, since there was nobody to speak for them.(There are some good science fiction stories written on this idea: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender's_Game">Enders Game</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_for_the_Dead">Speaker for the Dead</a> . The plot is that humans come in contact with an alien race which initailly seems attacking, though that was not their intend. No ways of communicating with them could be invented. In the end humans completely exterminate the alien race for their own survival. The person who lead the attack was able to do it, since he was able to understand the aliens feelings well. He later develops the ability to communicate with the last alien left, regrets his actions and Speaks for the Dead.) I really admire her fearlessness in speaking her mind, without caring about whether she will be ignored, which induced me to write this post.

For solving problems like Kashmir, the country should lend their ears to her words and understand the viewpoint of the people there. Apart from all these, this has generated a lot of much needed discussions on the Freedom of Speech. At least some more people would have heard about What X,Y, Z had to say about it. I am sure in a future the society as a whole will handle such a situation in a more mature way. I end with an interesting quote about Freedom of Speech
<blockquote>I disapprove of what you say, but i will defend to death your right to say it. -- Voltaire</blockquote>
