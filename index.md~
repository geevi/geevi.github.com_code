tagline: "I am a Phd Student in Computer Science at Tata Institute of 
Fundamental Research, Mumbai. I am passionate about computer science and 
mathematics. Currently i spend a lot of time studying them sometimes because i 
like it and sometimes because i have to. See this if you want to know exactly 
what i do. In an abandoned phase of my life i used to be a c++ programmer, web 
developer, free software activist and a linux hacker. Other than these, i love 
reading science fiction(favorites) and play badminton."
